Implement Client-Side Hashing

Do not send passwords in plain text to the API. Whether over SSL or not.
- Do Light weight Password Hashing to Encrypt the password on the client side
- Send the encrypted password to the server and hash a second time before comparing it to what is stored on the server.

While the password strength rules of validation can be stored on the server to ensure uniformity, all validation should be done on the client side.
The server should never have to decrypt the password sent from the client.

Use sha256 with CryptoJS for Client Side  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js
